# Birthday RSVP App

## Overview
This was a quick react app created for guests to RSVP to my birthday party. If you take a peek, you'll see it's all very cute-sy apres-skii themed.   

This was a very quick, effortless build intended to be a single-use tool. If you happen to be reading this as part of my portfolio, please understand that I intentionally omitted security steps and best practices for sake of simplicity. This was not a professional project. Please just focus on the UI lol.

## Specifics
### Front-end
-Single-page UI with swiper cards for navigation.  
-optimized for mobile phone only. Looks like absolute garbage on [desktop or tablet] and is unusable. This was considered fine for my use-case.

### Back-end
-Routed this to a Google Sheet for super simple viewing of my guestlist. I am aware this is not a real DB.  
-Did not create server to serve API key. I am aware this is a security risk, but again, absolutely no risk associated with this use case.
