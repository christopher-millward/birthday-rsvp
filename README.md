# Birthday RSVP App

## Overview
This was a quick single-page app created for guests to RSVP to my birthday party (apres-skii themed).   

This was a very quick build intended to be a single-use tool. If you happen to be reading this as part of my portfolio, please understand that I intentionally omitted security steps and best practices for sake of simplicity. Please just focus on the UI lol.

## Specifics
### Frontend
- Single-page react app with swiper cards for navigation.  
- Developed for mobile phone only. Looks like absolute garbage on [desktop or tablet] and is unusable. This was considered fine for my use-case.

### Backend
- Routed this to a Google Sheet for super simple viewing of my guestlist. I am aware this is not a real DB.
- Did not create server to serve API key. I am aware this is poor security practice, but again, absolutely no risk associated with this use case.
